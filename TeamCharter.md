# Team Charter for Handsfield Group: ~~Orthopaedic Structure and Function Laboratory~~

## Vision
The vision of the Handsfield group is to make scientific discoveries and solve complex orthopaedic and biomedical problems
using novel quantitative approaches, innovative modeling, and mechanistic science-based thinking. 
We use a variety of tools to accomplish our goals, including medical imaging, finite element modeling, agent based modeling,
complex analysis of systems, and many more. We are always looking to expand our toolset and engage in new collaborations.

## Mission
Our mission is to teach, to learn, to discover, and to solve.  
In our group, we aim to teach what we already know-- to the public, to one another, to our peers, and to our students.  
We aim to learn new things through scientific inquiry and daily use of technical tools.
We aim to make scientific discoveries through the dogged pursuit of our research questions and following our research to unexpected areas.
Lastly, we aim to solve the biomedical and scientific problems that we have posed for ourselves.

## Success Criteria
Success in the Handsfield lab is intrinsic to the members and their personal goals, and will be publicly acknowledged by members'
obtaining fellowship and/or grant funding for their work, publishing peer reviewed articles in scientific journals, presenting 
their work at scientific conferences, recognition for teaching and mentoring, translational success in moving ideas into clinical practice
or spin-off companies or patent applications, and dissemimation of our science to the lay public.

## Team Agreement

###### Behavioral Agreement
While the Handsfield lab greatly encourages unconventional thinking, freedom for radical self-expression, and license to be oneself, it is 
also essential that all members conduct themselves as professionals-- professional scientists, teachers, and disseminators. Members must
accept working individually and in teams and in both cases must behave in a way that fosters comfort, inclusion, and acceptance of those 
around them. Collaborative behavior is a must. Any behavior that is discriminatory, dismissive, or uncooperative is prohibited. In the 
laboratory, we ask that science is conducted in an ego-less way and that members are always open to learning, sharing, and engaging with
others in an open and egalitarian way.

###### Communication
Members of the Handsfield lab must be forthright, honest, and straightforward in their communications. This includes communication with lab
members, supervisors, colleagues, the public, and the scientific community. Science is the dogged pursuit of the truth. Honesty among and by
scientists is essential to the rigor and trust of science. Dishonest or misleading communication will result in censure or dismissal from 
the lab based on the magnitude of the transgression.

###### Roles and Responsibilities 
The lab is formally divided into the academic roles of director, post-docs, graduate students, undergraduates, and interns as well as
staff positions of manager and technicians. Cooperation among ALL members is required in order to promote the greater aims of the 
lab and scientific inquiry. Unsettled disagreements will be resolved by the director, by discussion among involved members, or by 
mediation with external parties where necessary. The director is responsible for setting the direction of the group and for obtaining
funding to continue the group's aims. The director will meet with lab members working on projects at regular intervals to inspect
progress and advise. Post-docs are responsible for the research relevant to the project to which they have been hired, for supervision
and consulting of graduate students, undergraduates, and interns. Post-docs may also be asked to teach lectures where necessary and to
represent the laboratory at conferences and public events. Gradaute students are responsible for their research projects, collaboration
with other graduate students and post-docs, and supervision of undergraduates and interns. Undergraduates and interns are responsible 
for the projects to which they have been hired. Technicians are responsible for conducting experiments and maintaining equipment and
will report to the lab director. Managers are responsible for all aspects of the laboratory and will report to the lab director.
All lab members are responsible for cleanliness and upkeep of the lab space and equipment.

###### Project Teams
Teams develop around projects that are being worked on collaboratively. All team members are to work diligently on their aims of the
project, to seek help from teammates and external collaborators, and to work constructively with one another.
