# Muscle Fiber Determination from Laplacian Simulations- A Comparison with DTI
## Conducting a Laplacian Simulation for Segmented Muscle Data
This step is performed using Autodesk Inventor CAD software
Use Manage>Import to pull STL muscle data into Autodesk Inventor
Use the Tool to create a base feature from STL
Create planes that transect the geometry at regular intervals
In each plane, create 2D cubic splines as a 2D Sketch that approximate the geometry
When finished, loft the cubic splines to a solid

## Loading Muscle Surfaces and Fibre Vectors from DTI
In order to perform analysis
